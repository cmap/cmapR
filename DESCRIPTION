Description: The Connectivity Map (CMap) is a massive resource of perturbational
  gene expression profiles built by researchers at the Broad Institute and 
  funded by the NIH Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures
  (LINCS) program. Please visit https://clue.io for more information.
  The cmapR package implements methods to parse, manipulate, and write common
  CMap data objects, such as annotated matrices and collections of gene sets.
